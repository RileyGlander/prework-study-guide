There are 4 sections. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section has its own notes you can read and learn about. If you need ideas on what to study, you are going to want to open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). There will be a console panel that will show up. From there you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
