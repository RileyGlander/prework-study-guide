## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? What motivated me was the feeling of how efficient and useful this study guide could be for anyone who needs it. To help others is my goal.
- Why did you build this project? Learning new languages is never easy. That is why I built this project. It is a great way to learn about the languages in a more organized and friendly manner.
- What problem does it solve? It solves the problem of having to scroll endlessly looking for the information you need.
- What did you learn? I learned coding can be challenging at first. It takes time and patience to learn just like any other skill.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, there will be 4 sections. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section has its own notes you can read and learn about. If you need ideas on what to study, you are going to want to open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).There will be a console panel that will show up. From there you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
